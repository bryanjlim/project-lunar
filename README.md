## App Description
A diary that helps you tally your life. How many times you’ve eaten at Chipotle? How many days you’ve been away from home? How many days you’ve felt unstoppable? Tally Diary helps you tally any range of items, even how many days it’s been since you were born! Or it can just act as your typical diary app. Diary entries are stored on a user's own cloud storage, so they're secure. Everything, from themes to cloud-sync to password protection, will be included. You don’t need a tally for the price, because it’s all going to be free.
